# eye-control-mouse
This project is created as an insight for future.By using our eye we can control the mouse of a computer and also when we blink it double clicks and selects the option.

üëÅÔ∏è Iris-Based Eye Mouse Controller

This project allows you to **control your computer cursor using eye movement** and **click by double blinking**, using your webcam. It uses **MediaPipe** for face and eye tracking, **OpenCV** for video input, and **PyAutoGUI** for controlling the mouse.

> Includes a simple GUI interface built with `tkinter` to start/stop the eye control easily.

2. Run the Python script:

```bash
python eye_mouse_gui.py
```

> Replace `eye_mouse_gui.py` with the name of your Python file if different.

 üì∑ How It Works

* Uses **MediaPipe's FaceMesh** with `refine_landmarks=True` to get accurate iris positions (landmark 474).
* Calculates your eye's (x, y) position and maps it to screen resolution.
* Detects blinking by comparing the vertical and horizontal eye landmark distance.
